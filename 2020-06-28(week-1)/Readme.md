# week 1

Right now I am starting to Learn Java, so there are some really basic but cool java programs from  a course I found online https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java/

I was asked to calculate the ISR (Impuesto Sobre la Renta). Which is needed to declare taxes. For this I worked had to learn towork with xml files. And ended up saving the client money from taxes.

I made a little program to parse text from screenshots, to help me translate faster screenshots of french dialogues.
