# week 1


I was asked to calculate the ISR (Impuesto Sobre la Renta). Which is needed to declare taxes. For this I worked had to learn towork with xml files. And ended up saving the client money from taxes.

I made a little program to parse text from screenshots, to help me translate faster screenshots of french dialogues.
