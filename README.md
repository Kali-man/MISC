# ManyDaysOfCode
Weekly sets of practice code...
I'll store here practice code. Eventually there will be:

* Cool projects or programming assignements from courses I found online.
* Quick and dirty solutions to problems that I was asked to solve.
* Maybe some HakerRankSolutions i'll want to remember
